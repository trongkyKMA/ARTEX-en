rem ARTEX supervisor start script - Windows

rem Usage:
rem   start.bat                  run in the foreground - Ctrl-C to stop
rem   start.bat -addr :9000      extra arguments are passed through to artex unchanged
rem
rem It does exactly one thing: run artex.exe, and when the process exits, decide from the exit code whether to start it again.
rem
rem   0      normal stop by the user  -> leave the loop
rem   75     restart requested        -> rerun immediately, after "One-click update" or "Roll back" in the UI
rem   other  crash                    -> rerun after a backoff: 1->2->4... up to 60 seconds
rem
rem Downloading, SHA256 verification and swapping binaries are not done here; artex does all of it itself at startup
rem in the selfupdate package. The script stays dumb; see the notes at the top of start.sh for details.
